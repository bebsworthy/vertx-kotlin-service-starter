# Sample service

## About

This sample package demonstrate how use Vert.x with kotlin's coroutines to

- Set up a web server
- Call a service over the Vert.x bus using Vert.x autogenerated proxy

The service is a very impressive string reversal service which may or not deserve it's own startup.

Once all the verticles are launched you can point your browser to http://localhost:9090/hello and it should display olleh


# What

**SampleServiceInf**

    in: src/java/paths/services/sample/

The interface for the service; all the method need to be declared here for the proxy and client generation to work

**SampleServiceVertxEBProxy and SampleServiceVertxProxyHandler**

    in: src/generated/paths/services/sample/

Those classes are auto-generated by codegen thanks to a bit of monkey patching in build.gradle; 
I couldn't figure out how (if at all possible) to get codegen to generate the proxy class from Kotlin interface so I 
gave up and wrote the interface in Java. :(


**SampleServiceImpl**

    in: src/kotlin/paths/services/sample

This is the actually implementation of the service. It implements the SampleServiceInf interface

**SampleServiceBusVerticle**

This verticle instanciate the service and register it on the vert.x bus

**SampleServiceBusConsumerVerticle**

This verticle create an HTTP server to capture the text input from the user; sends the text to the service via the bus 
and returns the response to the client
